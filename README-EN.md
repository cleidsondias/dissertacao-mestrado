## [RESUMO](/README.md) | ABSTRACT

Based on the proposed research problem: "Is it possible that the implementation of continuous
integration in agile development environments allows the delivery of products within the agreed
timeframes?", This research proposal will make an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms that can be
used in development environments to provide greater productivity and better performance in
product delivery.

In this way, an extensive IT bibliography and tools will be analyzed to participate
in Continuous Integration, as well as a case study based on the implementation of tools that can
help the agile team in the daily production in a company that develops software for to the insurance
market. Continuous integration and agile environments should be understood as internal processes
and procedures that enable a new form of relationship in environments that require a more dynamic
relationship among employees. 

The conclusions suggest that the Continuous Integration applied in
an agile environment can increase the quality of services, as well as the final product, within the
agreed deadlines. It also consists of a software development practice that assists in performing unit
testing, static code validation, and automatic delivery in integrated systems environments, ensuring
speed of delivery of value. 

The alliance of this practice with the work tables that are based on the
agile methodology is an important instrument in the support to the agile teams. From the general
objective, "Demonstrating the importance of continuous integration with agile development teams",
and based on an applied case study, the conclusions showed that the implementation of integration
environment in agile environments raises the quality of internal services and of the final product
delivered to the customer. However, further integration, such as the use of I.A and even the use of
quality assessment mechanisms such as the use of the ISHIKAWA diagram, can be further
enhanced.
